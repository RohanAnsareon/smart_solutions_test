            Have you ever watched “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and thought, “Why am I watching this movie by myself? I
            should be out with friends, hijacking a parade float”? Maybe that exact thought never occurred to you, but
            if you feel akin to Ferris, you’re probably an extrovert.

            In general terms, an extrovert is a person who is motivated by external stimuli. Extroverts tend to really
            like people and socializing and to have outgoing, vocal personalities.

            But there’s more to being an extrovert than talkativeness and wanting to party. Read on to learn more about
            extroverted personality traits and what it really means to be an extrovert.

            The makeup of an extrovert
            The introvert/extrovert divide has been around for about 100 years. In 1921, Carl Jung classified
            personality into two basic types: introvert and extravert.

            Jung chose the spelling “extravert” because it made sense in Latin, but we can’t help but notice “extra” is
            also a good way to describe these outgoing folks. Over time, the spelling changed to “extrovert” and
            psychologists found there was a lot more nuance to personality types than Jung originally prescribed.

            Some personality traits are common for a majority of extroverts, but not all these traits apply to all
            extroverts. Personality is a wide spectrum, and everyone has a different mix of traits.

            Some introverted traits seem to be ingrained. Others are a result of the culture we live in. For example,
            many introverts have learned to cope with constant overstimulation by putting up a wall. This leads people
            to believe that introverts are cold, or standoffish, but this is not our true nature. The innate qualities
            that most introverts share are a love of introspection, a need for solitude, and a slower, more focused
            communication style.

            Introverts love introspection
            “Living is like tearing through a museum. Not until later do you really start absorbing what you saw,
            thinking about it, looking it up in a book, and remembering – because you can’t take it in all at once.”
            ~Audrey Hepburn

            For introverts, introspection comes as naturally as breathing. We love to explore the colorful landscapes of
            our imagination. Many of us have been criticized for our mind wandering. We’ve been told to get our head out
            of the clouds and stop daydreaming. What people don’t understand is that there is a good reason for our
            inward ways.

            The outside world often feels like an assaulting force for introverts. At every turn there are energy
            vampires threatening to suck us dry. Turning inward is as much a means of survival as it is a source of
            comfort. Our love of introspection also brings meaning and direction to our life.

            I can remember contemplating the transience of life at five years old and feeling overwhelmed with emotion.
            I knew that our time here is short and ever-changing. Now that I’m all grown up, I spend ample time thinking
            about the very same thing. Today, introspection is a necessary part of my career as a writer and coach for
            introverts. It provides sustenance and shade from a world of neon lights and fluorescent personalities.
